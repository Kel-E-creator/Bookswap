# Book Swap Group Project - Team Cat Mode 2023 

# Description 
working as part of a team of 6 developers, using pair programming we were tasked to build a Book Swap website that manages a communal bookshelf.  
On the website the users can:

* See all the books that are available for borrowing
* Slaim a book, so that they can later grab it from the actual shelf
* See all the books that are currently “claimed“
* Return” a book, to signify that they have put it back on the shelf
* Review a book
* Add a new book to the system, if a new book has been added to the shelf search and filter books

### This project was built using React, HTML, and CSS.
